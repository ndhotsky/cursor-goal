## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Clarified public README and install wording around the in-chat Cursor workflow.
- Removed private future-confidence and release-copy planning notes from packaged docs.
- Dropped unused single-package pnpm workspace metadata.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Native Codex `/goal` parity harness covering single-file, multi-file, failing-checkpoint resume, already-complete, and fresh-process resume scenarios.
- Native parity documentation with the current evidence report and the observable contract used for comparison.
- Environment overrides for external state directories: `CURSOR_GOAL_STATE_DIR` and legacy workspace scope via `CURSOR_GOAL_STATE_SCOPE=workspace`.

### Changed

- Default goal state now lives outside the workspace under the user state directory for native Codex parity, instead of creating workspace `.goal/` files by default.
- `/goal resume` preserves existing goal settings unless the user explicitly supplies override flags.
- README, install, smoke-test, publishing, security, and issue-template docs now describe the external-state default.
